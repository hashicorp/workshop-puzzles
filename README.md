## Bite-sized Terraform Challenges

This repository contains Terraform challenges that you can do on your local workstation.

None of the challenges requires a cloud account or paid resource. You'll mainly be using `local_exec`, `local_file`, and the `null_resource` to challenge your Terraform skills.

These exercises have been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 Linux workstations.
